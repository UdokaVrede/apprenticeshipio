    We gather past, present, and future software engineering apprentices, and the employers and educators who love them.
    We advocate, empower, and create transparency around software engineering apprenticeships in the US in order to expand access and extend opportunity to software engineers from non-traditional education paths like bootcamps, community colleges, online programs, and self-directed study.
    We believe apprenticeships are a powerful tool to unlock human potential and to dismantle archaic, harmful beliefs in software engineering.

Our Story

<div class="story">
<center>
This project and community was originally inspired and created by a group of talented, caring Dev Bootcamp and Learner's Guild staff, students, and alumni in San Francisco and Oakland. When we started dreaming up this project in the fall of 2017, there were very few opportunities that welcomed and celebrated non-traditional education backgrounds in tech.<br><br>
We wanted to show companies that hiring non-traditional engineers through apprenticeship is valuable, affordable, and simple.  We wanted to dream about educational equity and envision what the tech industry could become.<br><br>
During COVID-19, we've been inspired to re-commit to this work with a new sense of importance and dedication. Today, we continue this work through advocacy, transparency, and empowerment across the United States.<br><br>
