# For the love of non-traditional software engineers

## The largest community of U.S. based software engineering apprenticeships... and the people who love them. 💜

#### "The true soldier fights not because she hates what is in front of her, but because she loves what is behind her." 
- G.K. Chesterton

# Background 💡
We advocate, empower, and create transparency around software engineering apprenticeships in the US in order to expand access and extend opportunity to software engineers from non-traditional education paths like bootcamps, community colleges, online programs, and self-directed study. We believe apprenticeships are a powerful tool to unlock human potential and to dismantle archaic, harmful beliefs in software engineering.

tl;dr We are working to make apprenticeships tech industry standard in the United States.

# Acknowledgements 👊
This project and community was originally inspired and created by a group of talented, caring Dev Bootcamp and Learner's Guild alumni in 2017. While their code is not any part of the app you see and use, their belief and support in this project while it was still a nascent and befuddled idea was critical in seeing the project through to release. Thank you to Marcos Cannabrava (https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcos-cannabrava/) for collaborating on ideas and your contributions to technical features.
