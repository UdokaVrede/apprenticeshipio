### The largest community of U.S. based software engineering apprenticeships.

# Background
Entering the tech industry as a software engineer with a non-traditional educational path has never been clear or easy. Little quality information and knowledge exists, and when it does, it's often obscured or biased to sell products or services. We decided to start an independent project to help non-traditional software engineers discover, obtain, and thrive in apprenticeship programs, regardless of their ability to afford expensive career coaching and immersive full time training. Sick of years of excuses and little action from employers, we also wanted to show companies that hiring non-traditional software engineers through apprenticeship is valuable, affordable, and simple. We want to provide transparency and accountability to encourage companies to practice what they preach and stop making excuses or perpetuating harmful stereotypes. We provide the resources to ignite positive change in engineering hiring and career development practices.

# Acknowledgements 
This project and community was inspired and created by a group of talented, caring Dev Bootcamp and Learner's Guild alumni. While their code is not any part of the app you see before you, their belief and support in this project while it was still a nascent and befuddled idea was critical in seeing the project through to release.
